Making this replica of the Bootstrap landing page is kinda challenging to me because im not good yet when i cant solve a problem for 20 minutes i asked one of my classmates for some information :) hehe he helped me alot . One challenge I encountered was positioning elements correctly, especially aligning sections like the navbar and the search bar. I solved this by using margin, padding, and flexbox to properly align elements and create the desired layout. This experience improved my skills in layout design and element organization.
