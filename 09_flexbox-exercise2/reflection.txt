After spending 7 hours on this challenge, Iâ€™ve gained a lot of insight into implementing layouts with Flexbox.

Difficulties Faced

Getting exact sizing right was my biggest challenge - balancing between relative units and fixed values.

how i solved them

Used pixel values for widths (400px for left panel, 150px for right boxes) with consistent 20px gaps

Combined flex properties with fixed dimensions to achieve the desired layout
